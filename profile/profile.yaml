# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a junior software developer with Jarvis and a recent graduate from the University of Toronto with a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. I have always been passionate about new technology, so I decided to pursue a career in the software industry to learn more about and get the chance to contribute to the innovations that have always excited me. I have experience working with REST APIs, data analytics, and application development, and I look forward to the opportunity to work in data engineering and expand my horizons in the software industry.
