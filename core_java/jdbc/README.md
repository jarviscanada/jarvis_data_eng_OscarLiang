# Introduction
This app makes use of the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) library to establish a connection to a PostgreSQL database to query and update it. The purpose of this project is to become familiar with the JDBC library as the project follows a Lynda.com course. This brief introduction to JDBC is important because other projects will build on this foundation.

# Design Patterns
The two primary design patterns used in JDBC are the Data Access Object (DAO) pattern and the Repository pattern. Both of them are useful in different situations.
